# @typed/io

A collection of tools for type-safe Domain Modeling and I/O validation. The core data structure, `Schema`, will help you to model 
your domain, derive the TypeScript types so there's 1 definition to maintain, as well as interpret your Schemas to create Constructors, 
Decoders, Encoders, Guards, JsonSchema, value-based deep-equality checking, and more to aid you in doing I/O validation.

Note: Under heavy development and not yet published, check back for more soon.
